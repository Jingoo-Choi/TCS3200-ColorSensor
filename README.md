# TCS3200-ColorSensor
TCS3200 - Color Sensor 


	TCS3200 is a library for color detection with TCS3200 module.

	The main objective is improve the performance detection of differente range colors
	for simple robotic applications.

	<ul>
		<li>Compute time event intervals to read input signal for non-blocking systems.</li>
		<li>Assign interruption pin to the INPUT signal to calculate samples. </li>
		<li>Compute buffer based on mean values and filtering errors.</li>
		<li>Mapping in different range values for colors.</li>
		<li>EEPROM memory for save some calibration data and color list.</li>
	</ul>
  
  This library is a modification of MD_TCS230 created by Marco Colli
